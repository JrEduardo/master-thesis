# General introduction # {#chapter0-intro}

Count data arise from random variables that take non-negative integer
values and typically represent the number of times an event occurs in an
observation period or region. This kind of data is also common in crop
sciences, examples including the number of grains produced by a plant,
the number of fruits on a tree, the number of insects captured by a
trap, etc.  Since the seminal paper of @Nelder1972, where the class of
the generalized linear models (GLMs) was introduced, the analysis of
count data often uses a Poisson regression model. This model provides a
suitable strategy for the analysis of count data and an efficient Newton
scoring algorithm that can be used for fitting.

In spite of the advantages of the Poisson regression model, the Poisson
distribution has only one parameter that represents both the expectation
and variance of the count random variable.  This equality restriction on
the relationship between the expectation and variance of the Poisson
distribution is referred as equidispersion.  However, in practical data
analysis such restriction can be unsuitable, since the observed data can
present variance both smaller or larger than the mean, leading to under-
and overdispersion, respectively.  While applying the Poisson regression
model to non-equidispersed count data can give consistent parameter
estimates, the associated standard errors are inconsistently estimated,
which in turn can lead to misleading inferences
[@Winkelmann1995; @Bonat2018].

In practice, overdispersion is widely reported in the literature and may
occur due to the absence of relevant covariates, heterogeneity of
sampling units, different observational periods/regions not being
considered in the analysis, and excess zeros [@Hinde1998].  The case of
underdispersion is less often reported in the literature, however, it
has been of increasing interest in the statistical community. The
processes that reduce the variability are not as well-known as those
leading to extra variability.  For this reason, there are few models to
deal with underdispersed count data. Possible explanatory mechanisms
leading to underdispersion may be related to the underlying stochastic
process generating the count data.  For example, when the time between
events is not exponentially distributed, the number of events can be
over or underdispersed; a process that motivated the class of duration
dependence models [@Winkelmann1995].  Another possible explanation
for underdispersion is when the responses correspond to order statistics
of component observations, such as maxima of Poisson distributed
counts [@Steutel1989].

Strategies for constructing alternative count distributions are related
to the causes of the non-equidispersion. Specifically for
overdispersion, Poisson mixture (compound) models are widely applied.
One popular example of this approach is the negative-binomial model,
where the expectation of the Poisson distribution is assumed to be gamma
distributed [@Hinde1998].  However, other distributions can also be used
to represent this additional random variation.  For example the
Poisson-Tweedie model [@Bonat2018] and its special cases Poisson
inverse-Gaussian and Neyman-Type A models assume that the random effects
are Tweedie, inverse Gaussian or Poisson distributed, respectively.  The
Gamma-Count distribution assumes a gamma distribution for the time
between events and it can deal with underdispersed as well as
overdispersed count data [@Zeviani2014]. The COM-Poisson distribution,
is obtained by a generalization of the Poisson distribution that allows
for a non-linear decrease in the ratios of successive probabilities
[@Shmueli2005] and can be seen as a particular case of the weigthed
Poisson distribution [@DelCastillo1998]. Related to negative binomial
distribution, the generalized Poisson is obtained as a limiting form of
generalized negative binomial distribution [@Consul1973]. A
comprehensive discussion on other generalizations of the Poisson
distribution can be found in @Winkelmann2008.

The classical regression model for the models from the exponential
family (generalized linear models) and for the aforementioned models is
linked to the mean (or expectation-related) parameter. Thereby, the
variance of the response variable is completely specified by the
variance function (be it known or not). However, this assumption cannot
be reasonable. For example, when there is an effect of a covariate
(treatment, dose, etc.) in both expectation and dispersion of
count. @Smyth1988 shows how to include a linear predictor for the
dispersion as well as for the mean in the generalized linear models. In
his paper, Smyth illustrates this with continuous data, but for discrete
data, his proposal can be extended by using quasi-likelihoods
[@Wedderburn1974]. For count data, a full parametric approach is
presented by @Rigby2005 using the so-called generalized additive models
for location, scale, and shape (GAMLSS).

The main objective of this thesis consists of exploring novel modeling
approaches for the analysis of count data. The remainder of the text is
organized as follow. In Chapter \@ref(chapter0-data), the motivating
datasets, mostly from biological experiments, and its challenges for
analysis are presented. Chapter \@ref(chapter1-reparcmp) is devoted to
present and study our novel reparametrization of COM-Poisson models. An
overview and comparison of some flexible probability distributions for
count data are addressed in Chapter \@ref(chapter2-models).  In Chapter
\@ref(chapter3-doublecmp) we consider double regression in the
reparametrized COM-Poisson models where the mean and the dispersion
parameters may be allowed to depend on covariates. Final considerations
are given in Chapter \@ref(chapterX-final).
