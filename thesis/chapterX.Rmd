# Final considerations # {#chapterX-final}

Count data arise from random variables that take non-negative integer
values and typically represent the number of times an event occurs in an
observation period or region. This kind of data is also common in crop
sciences, examples including the number of grains produced by a plant,
the number of fruits on a tree, the number of insects captured by a
trap, etc.  Since the seminal paper of @Nelder1972, where the class of
the generalized linear models (GLMs) was introduced, the analysis of
count data often uses a Poisson regression model. This model provides a
suitable strategy for the analysis of count data and an efficient Newton
scoring algorithm that can be used for fitting.
