This repository contains all the files for my master's thesis at
ESALQ-USP, Graduate Program in Agronomic Statistics and Experimentation
(PPGEEA). My research is about _Flexible Regression Models for Count
Data_. Gamma-Count, COM-Poisson and Poisson-Tweedie models are examples
of flexible models that I work. The goal is provide a unified framework
to fit this models and extend them to accomodate random effects. My
advisor is [Clarice Garcia Borges Demétrio][clarice].
